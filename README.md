# Sound Quiz
A version of my sound quiz build with Angular.js and no jQuery whatsoever.

#Information
- The quiz uses HTML5 audio to play a sound and the user has to guess what the sound is. 
- Each sound (except for one) was custom recorded and edited by me.
- Animations are custom CSS animations that integrate with Angular's ng-animate service.
